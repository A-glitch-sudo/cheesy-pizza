Flour- you can use all-purpose or bread flour. I prefer to use bread flour because it makes the crust a little chewier. But feel free to use what you have on hand.

Yeast- This recipe will work with both active dry yeast and instant or rapid rise. If you are using active dry it will take a little longer to rise or proof but that’s ok. I like to use Red Star All Natural Yeast because it’s the only yeast with no added ingredients.

Water- Yeast needs liquid to hydrate and dissolve it so it can do its job. Be sure your water is around 110-115 degrees F to activate the yeast. You can also replace the water with milk for a softer crust if you prefer.

Oil- I like to use extra virgin olive oil because it provides a nice flavor to the dough. It also keeps it tender.

Sugar- just a tiny bit to help feed the yeast.

Salt- Salt is very important in yeast baking because while sugar feeds the yeast to make it grow salt helps retard the growth and provides a steady rise to create that distinct homemade flavor.

Tomato sauce - 1⅓ cup (315ml homemade or store bought)

Tomato paste

Extra virgin olive oil

Seasonings- dried oregano, basil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper

Sugar– just a little to cut through the acidity of the tomatoes
