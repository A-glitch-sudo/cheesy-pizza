                                           "INGRIDENTS"


Flour- you can use all-purpose or bread flour. I prefer to use bread flour because it makes the crust a little chewier. But feel free to use what you have on hand.

Yeast- This recipe will work with both active dry yeast and instant or rapid rise. If you are using active dry it will take a little longer to rise or proof but that’s ok. I like to use Red Star All Natural Yeast because it’s the only yeast with no added ingredients.

Water- Yeast needs liquid to hydrate and dissolve it so it can do its job. Be sure your water is around 110-115 degrees F to activate the yeast. You can also replace the water with milk for a softer crust if you prefer.

Oil- I like to use extra virgin olive oil because it provides a nice flavor to the dough. It also keeps it tender.

Sugar- just a tiny bit to help feed the yeast.

Salt- Salt is very important in yeast baking because while sugar feeds the yeast to make it grow salt helps retard the growth and provides a steady rise to create that distinct homemade flavor.

Tomato sauce - 1⅓ cup (315ml homemade or store bought)

Tomato paste

Extra virgin olive oil

Seasonings- dried oregano, basil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper

Sugar– just a little to cut through the acidity of the tomatoes

1 ball Best Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)

1/3 cup Easy Pizza Sauce

4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese

4 ounces (1 cup) shredded mozzarella cheese

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder


1 teaspoon dried oregano

Kosher salt

Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel


Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)


Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).

Make the pizza sauce: Make the Easy Pizza Sauce.

Prepare the toppings: Slice or tear the fresh mozzarella into small pieces.

Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.

Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the pieces of fresh mozzarella cheese evenly across the dough, then top with the shredded mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle evenly with the garlic powder, dried oregano, and a few pinches of kosher salt.

Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.
